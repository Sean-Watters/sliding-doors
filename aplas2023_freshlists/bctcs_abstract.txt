Title: Extensional Finite Sets and Multisets in Agda

Lists and list-like types are easy to represent in type theory.
However, sets and multisets are more troublesome; without
advanced features such as quotient types, representations of them
typically lack decidable equality, extensionality, or both. In this
talk, I will discuss how to realise finite sets and multisets as
free idempotent commutative monoids and free commutative monoids,
using a generalisation of Catarina Coquand's data type of fresh lists.
I will also show how many other free structures also can be realised
using this data type.
