Extensional Finite Sets and Multisets in Agda

Abstract:
---------
Lists and list-like types are easy to represent in type theory.
However, sets and multisets are more troublesome; without advanced features such as quotient types, representations of these typically lack either decidable equality or the correct equational theory.
In this talk, I will discuss how to realise finite sets and multisets in Agda, while maintaining the above desiderata.
We achieve this using a generalisation of Catarina Coquand's data type of fresh lists.
Our constructions satisfy properties akin to (multi)set extensionality, which allows us to prove that they satisfy the universal properties of the free idempotent commutative monoid and free commutative monoid, respectively.
I will also show how fresh lists realise many other free algebraic structures.

This is joint work with Clemens Kupke and Fredrik Nordvall Forsberg, and was published at APLAS 2023:

All our constructions and results are formalised in Agda, and available at:
