The Madness of the Modal $\mu$-Calculus
========================================

My PhD is more or less about "how to $\mu$-calculus in Agda".
It turns out to be tricky.
In this talk, I'll introduce you to the modal $\mu$-calculus, well-scoped de Bruijn syntax, and a new take on that which I've been developing recently.

I'll start by introducing and motivating the field of model checking, before quickly diverting to the modal $\mu$-calulus, a fixpoint modal logic of foundational importance in that field.
I'll talk about its semantics first, beacause that's only sensible, then the rest of the talk will be devoted to the weird and wonderful (but mostly weird) syntactic issues that arise from this formalism.

In particular, there is an important syntactic construction called "the closure" of a $\mu$-calculus formula which is not stable under alpha-equivalence, and whose inductive structure is somewhat non-obvious.
The solution turns out to be an extension of well-scoped de Bruijn syntax that I've been calling "sublimely-scoped" terms.

Overall, I hope to convince you that the modal $\mu$-calculus is an interesting object of study for type theorists, which can teach us a lot about our craft.
